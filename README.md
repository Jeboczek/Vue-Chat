## Updated version !!!
The project you are viewing now was created during my first steps with VueJs. 
If you want to see the second version of this project [click here](https://github.com/Jeboczek/Vue-Chat-2).


## What is it?
A simple web application that allows you to communicate with others using rooms. The project uses Firebase to exchange messages.

The application was created just to get familiar with the Vue framework, it is not intended for production use.
